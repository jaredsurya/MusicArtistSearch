# Music Artist Search

This project was made with help from Flatiron School, using the API from theaudiodb.com.

It's usage is simple. Just type in an artist you're curious about and press GO!

From there, buttons to display a description, discography, or music videos appears.

Note: Music videos will not populate correctly when viewed from a local host. 
I used http-server npm add-on to make sure it works right when hosted from a domain.
The github.io page hosts it correctly.
